# The default storageclass for NooBaa is ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd. This causes
# issues during ODF uninstallation. The storage cluster is being deleted while NooBaa
# still uses a PVC (db-noobaa-db-pg-0) provisioned from the storage cluster.
# This option allows setting the storageclass to something else like for example
# gp3-csi on AWS, so that the uninstallation of ODF doesn't get stuck.
